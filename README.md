# GrasslandDegradation

This repository hosts the code for detecting and attributing the grassland degradation and desertification using the residential trend analysis method.

## code list
- dataPrepare.js: MODIS data pre-processing + desertification zone ifentification (including thermal growing season extraction)
- trendAnalysis.js: theil sen'slope + mannkendall tau
- attributionAnalysis.js: seperate the effects of *CO2 fertilization*、*land use*、*climate change*、*climate variability*、*other factors*  



The detailed description of this method can be found in the following papers.
